# FinTech_Module_13 Challenge

# Background

In this challenge, we posed as a risk management associate at Alphabet Soup, a venture capital firm. The team has asked you to help them create a model that predicts whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. To make the evaluation, we were given a CSV file containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup. The CSV file provides information on each business, including whether or not it ultimately became successful. Our challenge was to apply machine learning and neural networks to create a binary classifier model to predict whether an applicant will become a successful business.

# Results

I tested four models in addition to the original model trying relu and tanh for the activation and altering the number of inputs, epochs, and hidden layers. The most accurate model of those I tried was A1 which had one hidden layer.
